# Project Development Plan

## Project Overview
[Brief description of the project and its goals]

## Objectives
- [ ] Primary objective 1
- [ ] Primary objective 2
- [ ] Primary objective 3

## Technical Requirements
### Architecture
- Framework/Language: [e.g., Python/FastAPI, Node.js/Express]
- Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB]
- External Services: [e.g., AWS S3, Redis]

### Key Features
1. **Feature 1**: [Description]
2. **Feature 2**: [Description]
3. **Feature 3**: [Description]

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Iteration 1-3)
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Configure development environment
- [ ] Implement core data models
- [ ] Create basic API endpoints

### Phase 2: Core Features (Iteration 4-8)
- [ ] Implement authentication system
- [ ] Build main business logic
- [ ] Add data validation
- [ ] Create unit tests

### Phase 3: Polish & Deploy (Iteration 9-12)

- Clear documentation for all endpoints
- Deployment ready with CI/CD

## Known Constraints
- Budget: [if applicable]
- Timeline: [deadline if any]
- Technical: [any technical limitations]

## Questions for Consideration
These will be automatically generated based on this plan, but you can add specific concerns here:
- How should we handle [specific technical challenge]?
- What's the priority order for features?
- Are there any security considerations we should address early?
